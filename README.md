# GGUF PYTHON PARSER
Main goal is to understand gguf structure and how it is been utilized to load model.

## TODO
[] GGUF_METADATA_VALUE_TYPE_FLOAT32.read should able to handle big-endian
[] GGUF_METADATA_VALUE_TYPE_ARRAY.read should able to handle all type of values (currently only handling string).
